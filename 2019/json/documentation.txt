schedule.json is exported from frab and parsed by php code in the newline page

either export manually and put it here, or use a live version published by frab
e.g. on https://frab.hackerspace.gent/en/newline0x09/public/schedule.json

if using the live version, realise that anyone with edit access to a frab event
may inject javascript into our newline page.
