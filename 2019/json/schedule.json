Looking at established composers and artists who have used their synaesthesia in their works, we will see how the phenomenon relates to the ways we combine sounds and colours, which electronic tools we can use to recreate it, and how we can make art from it.","description":"The idea of a colour-music connection, that there is a natural connection between our perception of sound and colour, exists throughout the history of art and philosophy. Some artists and composers have even claimed that they could ‘see’ music or ‘hear’ colours. It is only in the last century that synaesthesia, the experience of multiple senses from a single sensory input, has gained recognition as a legitimate (but rare) neurological condition. While most of us think how we connect different sounds with different colours is personal (and even random), the existence of synaesthesia shows that it has a collective biological and perceptual basis. Synaesthesia, and its aesthetic reception in non-synaesthetes, opens new avenues in research regarding the relationship between sound and colour. As a part of my PhD research into this subject, the aim of this lecture is to discuss synaesthesia in composers and artists, and talk about how it relates to the interconnectedness of our perception of the senses. The ways of recreating synaesthetic experiences electronically, and using synaesthesia as a performance tool will be shown with live examples using Max/MSP/Jitter and Ableton Live.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":60,"public_name":"Umut Eldem"}],"links":[],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://frab.hackerspace.gent/en/newline0x09/public/events/26","id":26,"guid":"5b1ed890-76d1-4f7e-a183-2f3025318c4e","logo":null,"date":"2019-04-27T16:30:00+02:00","start":"16:30","duration":"00:45","room":"lecture room","slug":"newline0x09-26-ancestry_testing","title":"Ancestry Testing","subtitle":"","track":null,"type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"In this talk I hope to explain how ancestry testing is performed, what it can tell you, and discuss ethical concerns.","description":"","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":72,"public_name":"alex"}],"links":[],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://frab.hackerspace.gent/en/newline0x09/public/events/13","id":13,"guid":"19dfdc32-f10a-41f7-bb48-0ca892f644d0","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/000/013/large/Home_Assistant_Logo.svg.png?1552650956","date":"2019-04-27T17:15:00+02:00","start":"17:15","duration":"00:45","room":"lecture room","slug":"newline0x09-13-home_assistant","title":"Home Assistant","subtitle":"Automate your home with FOSS","track":null,"type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"presenting our implementations of home assistant and related home automation stuff","description":"","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":59,"public_name":"Mike"},{"id":58,"public_name":"thouters"}],"links":[{"url":"https://www.home-assistant.io/","title":"Home Assistant"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://frab.hackerspace.gent/en/newline0x09/public/events/19","id":19,"guid":"11ba517d-dc68-4e96-895e-d0b052c1cc0f","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/000/019/large/2pi.jpg?1550068373","date":"2019-04-27T18:15:00+02:00","start":"18:15","duration":"00:45","room":"lecture room","slug":"newline0x09-19-building_musical_automats","title":"Building musical automats","subtitle":"2pi, a miniature organ","track":null,"type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"The Logos Foundation is over 50 years active in combining the fields of music, art and technology.

We also analyze unsafe Noise patterns and discover potential attacks. All of this work is consolidated into a usable online tool that presents a compendium of results and can parse formal verification results to generate detailed-but-pedagogical reports regarding the exact security guarantees of each message of a Noise Handshake Pattern with respect to each party, under an active attacker and including malicious principals.

Picto automatically translates Dutch natural language text into pictographs and vice versa, allowing people with limited literacy skills to read and write status updates, emails, and chat messages in online environments.","description":"For the conversion of texts into pictographs, we start from an existing system. We evaluate the baseline Text-to-Pictograph translation system using a combination of automated metrics, manual assessments, and user studies, and we propose three major improvements: We create a spelling correction tool for people with ID, we develop a syntactic simplification tool and a temporality detection module, and we implement a word sense disambiguation tool for improved semantic analysis. \r\n\r\nConversely, the Pictograph-to-Text translation tool provides help in constructing textual messages by allowing the user to input a series of pictographs, and translates these messages into natural language text. The challenge in Pictograph-to-Text translation is twofold. The first task concerns the development of an accessible interface that allows people with ID to find the pictographs of their choice. The second task is the actual development of the Pictograph-to-Text translation engine. We discuss a variety of approaches, including language modelling and (neural) machine translation techniques, toward the generation of rich natural language text from underspecified pictograph input.","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":73,"public_name":"Leen Sevens"}],"links":[{"url":"http://picto.ccl.kuleuven.be/","title":"Picto demo"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://frab.hackerspace.gent/en/newline0x09/public/events/15","id":15,"guid":"a3c354e2-3ea8-4bc4-9257-925febfec3f0","logo":null,"date":"2019-04-28T15:30:00+02:00","start":"15:30","duration":"00:45","room":"lecture room","slug":"newline0x09-15-technologische_soevereiniteit_2_-_het_boek","title":"Technologische Soevereiniteit 2 - Het Boek","subtitle":"Over de reis met enkelen om een boek te vertalen","track":null,"type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"This presentation which will first of all introduce you to the writings that are part of the 'sobtec2'-book and further stimulate to develop  alternative ways to the narratives forced upon us by 'high-tech companies' and governments infested with misguided constructs of technological advancements that work best for them.\r\n","description":"We'll try to discover ways around the walled gardens that are in place and very supportive to keep global power structures in place to further exploit humans on an individual basis as well as trying to recuperate connected communities by corrupting.\r\n\r\nBesides a short intro into the theme and the various resulting essays that the project has produced, we'll discuss experiences gathered during the translation process, the printing phase and of publishing an actual book.\r\n\r\n","recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":61,"public_name":"vhill"}],"links":[{"url":"https://github.com/sobteclib/sobtec2/tree/master/nl","title":"Technologische Soevereiniteit Volume 2"}],"attachments":[]},{"url":"https://frab.hackerspace.gent/en/newline0x09/public/events/2","id":2,"guid":"b3c97d89-63cf-4f68-baad-233549ceb68a","logo":"/system/events/logos/000/000/002/large/Openstreetmap_logo.svg.png?1547310307","date":"2019-04-28T16:15:00+02:00","start":"16:15","duration":"00:45","room":"lecture room","slug":"newline0x09-2-openstreetmap_what_is_it_and_how_do_i_contribute","title":"OpenStreetMap: what is it and how do I contribute?","subtitle":"An introduction to OSM for who has never heard about it","track":null,"type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"This talk gives a basic introduction on OpenStreetMap - a bit of history, comparison with other map providers, ...
