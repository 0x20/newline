This hypothesis has been put forward before, but without hard evidence. I provide such evidence, which is mainly based on the analysis of mean squared distances for ngrams. This analysis is applied across various ciphers: z340, z408, which is the other major cipher by the Zodiac Killer, twenty generated ciphers based on real texts, and twenty fake ciphers based on random letter sequences. The results show that z340 behaves unlike other true ciphers. Instead, it associates with the fake ciphers.",
