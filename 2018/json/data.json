This talk can lead into a discussion, where we can all talk about what works well and not so well for our hackerspaces so we can all learn from each other, and so people from yet-to-be hackerspaces can get off to a better start.",

Luckily a few years ago a new concept emerged: Devops. Devops is about combining multiple teams (mostly Developers and Operators) to enable the rapid development and evolution of products and services; and reduce the risk, improve the quality and reduce costs of building those projects. The Devops community also utilizes a lot of tools. Ever heard about Jenkins? Always wanted to know what this GIT is? This session will bring clarity in all the fancy buzzwords.",

Several prototypes for embedded systems, and also the Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) included in recent Intel x86 processors, ensure isolation with a hardware-only TCB. This talk, based on my ongoing PhD research, highlights two complementary lines of PMA research. On the one hand, I will introduce the free/open-source Sancus hardware-level PMA and embedded (automotive) security applications we are actively developing. On the other hand, I will overview our recent research efforts on side-channel attacks against off-the-shelf Intel SGX platforms.",
